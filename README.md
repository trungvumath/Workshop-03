# Workshop-3
This material is part of INMAS Workshop #3 - Machine Learning

## Setup of Python environment and preparation notebook

  1. Download the Jupyter notebook `session0a_test_environments.ipynb`. Run this notebook to install the Python packages that we will need throughout the workshop. It will also down a dataset in a folder called `FashionMNIST` which we will need later. <br> <br>
  If you run into any issues when trying to execute the notebook, you can use the environment file `environment.yml` and create a new conda environment. <br> This can be done by navigating the terminal / Anaconda Prompt to the folder which contains the `environment.yml` file and using the commands <br>
  `conda env create --name inmas-ml --file environment.yml` <br>
  `conda activate inmas-ml`.

  2. Download and execute the Jupyter notebook `session0b_preparation.ipynb` to recap some notions of [Workshop 2 from November](https://github.com/INMAS-Math/Workshop-02) and to familiarize yourself with the [scikit-learn package](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).
