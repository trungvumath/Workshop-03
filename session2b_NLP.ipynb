    "[VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14550), proposed by C. Hutto and E. Glibert in 2014, uses lexicons and rules to evaluate the sentiment expressed in text. It is particularly useful in the context of evaluating sentiments in social media. Using VADER in Python is surprisingly simple. Below you can apply VADER to get an idea of how NLP can be used."
